EMI_FORMULA_RESPONSE = """
EMI is calculated using the standard amortization formula:

EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n − 1)

Where:
P = Loan amount (principal)
r = Monthly interest rate (Annual Interest Rate / 12)
n = Loan tenure in months

EMI includes both principal and interest components.
Exact installment amount depends on sanctioned rate and loan agreement.
"""

INTEREST_EXPLANATION_RESPONSE = """
Loan interest is calculated based on the outstanding principal and the applicable interest rate defined in the loan agreement.

In reducing balance method, interest is calculated on the remaining principal after each EMI payment.

In flat rate method, interest is calculated on the entire principal for the full tenure.

Exact values depend on sanctioned terms.
